% `` The existing CAD tools are geared for manual use. Unfortunately, the manual production of large amounts of complex architectural forms is very time consuming. Procedural generation of these forms is one of the approaches which considerably speed up this process . This approach is the algorithmic construction of these forms , using grammars forms , L -systems , Automatic Phones, etc. This thesis aims to exploit these techniques and their implementation in Rosetta tool. The assessment may include generation of urban environments , buildings and ornaments according to a certain style arquitect√≥nico.``

The existing graphic creation tools are geared for manual use. Unfortunately, the manual production of large amounts of complex architectural forms is very time consuming. Procedural generation of these forms is one of the approaches which considerably speed up this process. This approach consists in the algorithmic construction of these forms through diferent techniques like shape grammars, L-Systems, etc. This project aims to explore this approach and apply it to the procedural modeling of cities by the development of a tool that, in connection with the Rosetta tool, will provide a new mean for the users to explore this approach.
