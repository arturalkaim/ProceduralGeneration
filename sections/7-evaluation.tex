\section{Evaluation (1/2pgs)  [NOT DONE]}
\label{sec:evaluation}

% Explain how you are going to show your results (statistical data, cpu performance etc). Answer the following questions:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Why is this solution going to be better than others.
%   \item How am I going to defend that it is better.
% \end{itemize}
\cite{Kelly}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Realism – Does the generated city look like a real city?
	\item Scale – Is the urban landscape at the scale of a city?
	\item Variation – Can the city generation system recreate the variation of road networks and buildings found in real cities or is the output homogeneous?
	\item Input – What is the minimal input data required to generate basic output and what input data is required for the best output?
	\item Efficiency – How long does it take to create the examples shown and on what hardware are they generated? How computational efficient is the algorithm?
	\item Control – Can the user influence city generation and receive immediate feedback on their actions? Is there a tactile intuitive method of control available or is the control restricted? To what degree can the user influence the generation results?
	\item Real-time – Can the generated city be viewed in real-time? Are there any rendering optimisation techniques applied to enable real-time exploration?
\end{enumerate}
