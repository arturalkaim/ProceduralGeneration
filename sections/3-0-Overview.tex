\subsection{Procedural Generation} % (fold)
\label{sub:procedural_generation}


\emph{Procedural Generation} is the algorithmic generation of content instead of the usual manual creation of content. This can be applied in almost all forms of content, but is mostly used in graphics creation and sound (music and synthetic speech).

The key property of procedural generation is that in describes the data entity, be it geometry, texture or effect, in terms of a sequence of generation instructions rather than as a static block of data \cite{Kelly}. This allows the production of big volumes of detailed, and high quality graphic content without the costs, both in time and price, of manual content creation.
