 Voxels

``Voxel is a combination of ``volume" and ``pixel" ". i. e. the equivalent to pixels in 3D. In other words, if a pixel is a tiny square that represents a part of an model in a plane (picture), a voxel is a cube that represents a part of a model in a space.
Because we usually want to model the world, or parts of it, that have three dimensions, it's easier to visualize this models with voxels.
